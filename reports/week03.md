## Introduction: Weekly Problem <a name="introduction"></a>

In this part of the project, we firstly form a team, in which working together and supporting each other, we wish to finish the project successfully. The first presentation must be performed in the second week. Therefore, comprehensive and efficient project management is needed. The tasks must be assigned appropriately in order to finish the preparation for the presentation in a short amount of time. In the third week, the requirements of the customer for the application will be received and proceeded further to build a structure for the app.

## Goals <a name="data"></a>

Based on the given tasks, the goals of this part are:
* Assign appropriate tasks to each team member based on their skill set. 
* Complete a good presentation preparation one day before the deadline.
* Build a structure for the application based on the requirements of the customer.

## Progress

In the first two weeks, we have finished the tasks on time as well as have gained several experiences, either from the course material, from other team members, and from other team's performances. In addition, there are also some problems that we spotted during the progress, which we expect to overcome to perform better in the upcoming weeks.

### _Individual assignment completion_

According to tasks assignment in the project plan, every team member has contributed to the team presentation milestone as well as the beginning part of the basic prototype milestone. With the organization of MayuraGurjar, the team has met several times to discuss the content of the team presentation and what should be explained during the presentation. Kim took the responsibility of designing the presentation based on the ideas of every team member. Mehrun volunteered to be the first presenter and has successfully explained the team's ideas to all audiences.
After the meeting with the customer, one meeting was organized and new roles were assigned to team's members as following:

| Team Member Name | Primary Responsibility | Secondary Responsibility |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Thi Kim Nhung Phan | System Design | Quality Control |
| Madhuri Arun Tawde | Product Owner | Final Implementation |
| Mayura Gurjar Cheepinahalli Vasudeva | Requirement Analysis, Quality Assurance | Team Management |
| Venkatesh Thirugnana Sambandham | Scrum Master | Task Distribution |
| Mehrun A S Khan | Blog Writing and App Design | Testing |

Even though each member has a specific role, however, they will also contribute to all the tasks of other members in order to learn new skills. In the last part of the team presentation milestone, the blog article was finished by the presenter of this milestone, Mehrun, with support from all team members. For the first part of the basic prototype milestone, Venkatesh, the scrum master, has built several functions for the app, which can be learned and processed further by other team members. All ideas for the weekly report was gathered and combined by Kim. 

### _Achievement_

* __Project Management__: by finished the first milestone together and by preparing for its content, the team understands the agile project management concept. The importance of complementary skills, the importance of assigning the appropriate tasks to the appropriate members to maximize the working efficiency was learned. Besides, the project plan was also adjusted in order to gain flexibility in case of changing circumstances.
* __Design of Presentation__: from the lecture guideline as well as from other teams' presentations, we have learned the way of designing an intuitive and interesting presentation.
