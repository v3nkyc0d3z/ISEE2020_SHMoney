## Introduction: Weekly Problem <a name="introduction"></a>

In this part of the project, we firstly form a team, in which together and support each other, we wish to finish the project sucessfully. The fist presentation must be performed in the second week. Therefore, a comprehensive and efficient project management is needed. The tasks must be assigned appropriately in order to finish the preparation for the pesentation in a short amount of time. In the third week, the requirements of customer for the application will be received and proceeded further to build a structure for the app.

Based on the given tasks, the goals of this part are:
* Assign appropriate tasks to each team member based on their skill set.

## Progress

In the first two weeks, we have finished the tasks on time as well as have gained several experience, either from the course material, from other team members, and from other team's performances. In addition, there are also some problem that we spotted during the progresss, which we expect to overcome to perform better in the upcoming weeks.

### _Individual assignment completion_

According to tasks assignment in the project plan, every team member has contributed to the team presentation milestone as well as the beginning part of the basic prototype milestone. With the organization of MayuraGurjar, the team has met several times to discuss about the content of team presentation and what should be explained during the presentation. Kim took the resposibility of designing the presentation based on ideas of every team member. Mehrun voluntered to be the first presenter and has sucessfully explained the team's ideas to all audiences.
After the meeting with customer, one meeting was organized and new roles were assigned to team's members as following:

Even though each member has a specific role, however, they will also contribute to all the tasks of other members in order to learn new skills. The last part of team presentation milestone, the blog article was finisied by the presenter of this milestone, Mehrun, with the support from all team. For the first part of the basic prototype milestone, Venkatesh, the scrum master, has built several functions for the app, which can be learnt and processed further by other team members. All ideas for the weekly report was gathered and combined by Kim.
