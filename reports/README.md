# Weekly Team Status Reports

In this folder, you have t put your weekly reports as markdown files.
The file for the first report already exists, but is intenionally left blank.
For the further reports, create a markdown file with a corresponding name, respectively.

Each team report contains the following section:

* Section 1: It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week that is, your goals from a week ago. (It can be empty for the first)
* Section 2: Should report the progress you've made this week: what you've done, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
Here, you should also indicate the roles and responsibilities/tasks of each team member in the recent week.
* Section 3: Should outline your plans and goals for the following week (including who is responsible for wat). Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into your tasks for the next week. It's good to include some less-detailed longer-range schedule items in this list as well, so that you don't think just about the next week.
* Section 4: an agenda for the meeting with your TA.
