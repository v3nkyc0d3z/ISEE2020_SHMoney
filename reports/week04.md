## _Progress_
In the last week of meeting, we successfully completed our first Blog and first Milestone which was presented by Mehrun and 
submitted our weekly report before deadline. Furthermore, we have assigned the roles and responsibilities for each team member with 
the desired skills as we look forward to finish the project successfully and efficiently. The tasks are assigned appropriately in order
to prepare the presentation and basic prototype for next Milestone. 
## _Roles and Responsibility_
As we have learned that we have to be ready with basic prototype containing all essential requirements on running app, we have been
currently working on some of the essential requirements, we have assigned below roles:
* __Product Owner__- Madhuri Arun Tawde
*  __Scrum Master__- Venkatesh Thirugnana Sambandham
* __Team Members__- Thi Kim Nhung Phan,
               Mayura Gurjar Cheepinahalli Vasudeva,
               Mehrun A S Khan
## Individual assignment of Task
We need to focus on both technical and strategical part of the project and since our team comprises of both Management and
Technology background, we have divided team into two having coding and managerial teams ,each member will be working on the key
responsibilities, however, they will also contribute to all the tasks of other members in order to explore new skills. Currently each 
member is studying the concepts of class and activity diagram which will be included in our next Milestone. On short term we have planned
on to below tasks on which individual/team of two will be working on
*	Mayura- Studying UML diagrams
*	Venkatesh and Kim-Implementation of essential requirements  
*	Madhuri and Mehrun-Studying the database handling in android studio
## Roadblocks 
As some of the members are not well-versed or do not have any hands on experience in coding, it requires an extra efforts 
to learn and implement various tasks.

## Plans and Goals for Upcoming weeks
Based on the given tasks, the goals of this part are:
*	To start implementing few of the essential requirements
*	Preparation for the next milestone with basic prototype.
## Meeting Agenda
