# Software Engineers Blog / Wiki

This is the main page of your repository for the course project that is a center piece of the lecture "Introduction to Software Engineering for Engineers" in summer term 2020.

In this lecture, each student group needs to report on the project progress via **Blog / Wiki entries and weekly status reports**.
We will link all Blogs / Wikis as far as they are set up (presumably in the 3rd week of the semester).
Moreover, each student group will use GitLab hosted by the OvGU to host the source code and showing their contributions by frequent commits to all kind of artifacts.
Apart from that, you are also free to use your GitLab repository for further documents or deliverables you would like to share among your team members.
Finally, the grades of your deliverables will be uploaded to the repository by the lecturer.


## Basic Information
This repository already comes with some content to ease the start for creating your Blog and weekly reports.

* Once you have done this, please fill the `REAMDE.md` file. It should contain:
    * information about your project
    * links to release versions of your App (i.e., the respective .apk files)
    * anything else you want the present on first view
* The Blog / Wiki entries are created on GitLab in the Wiki section of your project. The Wiki uses Markdown similar to this GettingStarted.md, more information in the next Section. We  will try to make your Wiki available to the other teams as soon as possible.
* Your team reports should be created in the folder [/reports](./reports). More information there.
* First-hand information about Git
    * Git cheat sheet: [PDF](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf) | [web page](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide)
    * More information in [Moodle](https://elearning.ovgu.de/course/view.php?id=7289)

## Markdown

One more word about markdown: Is is a really easy-to-learn markup language, similar to those used in Wikis.
Here is a link to all important command on one page: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf).

Additionally, there is a great web page with lots of examples for using Markdown, including how to integrate images, videos etc.
Here is the link: [Markdown reference](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Just as a brief example since I think you will need that quite often: Below you can find an image with a relative reference to its path.

<span align="center">
![Deadline image](./media/phdcomic-deadlines.gif "Remind the deadlines")
</span>

You can even add an image inline ![Deadline image](./media/blob.png "Beware of the Blob"){:height="30%" width="30%"}., which means that it will appear within the text, directly at the place where you located the link. And, it is even resized ;)
